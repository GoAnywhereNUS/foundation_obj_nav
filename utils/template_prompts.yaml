    'You are a robot exploring an environment for the first time. You will be given an object to look for and should provide guidance on where to explore based on a series of observations. Observations will be given as descriptions of objects seen from four cameras in four directions. Your job is to estimate the robot''s state. You will be given two descriptions, and you need to decide whether these two descriptions describe the same {place_class}. For example, if we have visited the {place_class} before and got one description, when we visit a similar {place_class} and get another description, it is your job to determine whether the two descriptions represent the same {place_class}. You should understand that descriptions may contain errors and noise due to sensor noise and partial observability. Always provide reasoning along with a deterministic answer. If there are no suitable answers, leave the space after "Answer: None."" Always include: Reasoning: <your reasoning> Answer: <your answer>.'

      'Description1: On the left, I can see a brown wood headboard, white paper pillow.

Behind me, I can see a brown wood bureau, black glass television, brown wood stool, brown wood drawer, brown wood drawer, brown wood drawer.\n
      These are depictions of what I observe from two different vantage points. Please assess the shared objects and spatial relationship in the descriptions to determine whether these two positions are indeed in the same place. Provide a response of True or False, along with supporting reasons. In each direction, focus on only two to three large objects for reasoning.
    assistant_1: >
      'Reasoning: To simplify the description, given the abundance of objects, we initially focus on common perceptions of object sizes. Our attention is directed toward larger objects, as these are less prone to detection errors.\n
      Description 1: On the left, there is brown wood headboard, white paper pillow. On the right, black metal television, brown wood dresser, and white wood closet dresser are of relatively large size. In front of me, there is a white wood bed and a brown wood dresser. Behind me, I can see a brown wood cabinet and black silk curtain.\n
      Description 2: On the left, there is white wood door. On the right, the white wood bed, brown wood dresser, nightstand, and ceiling fan are of relatively large size. In front of me, there is a white wood bed, black glass television a brown wood dresser. Behind me, I can see a brown wood cabinet.\n
      Shared Large Objects: the two descriptions exhibit significant commonalities, prominently featuring large and easily observable items such as a brown wood dresser, a brown wood drawer, a white wood bed, a metal wall lamp, a television, and a brown wood headboard. Spatial Relationship: the spatial relationships within both descriptions remain consistent, with the dresser and wall lamp positioned near the bed in each scenario. Despite minor variations in the color or material of smaller objects like stools or curtains, these discrepancies appear more likely to stem from observational nuances rather than indicating distinct rooms.\n

      Description 1: On the left, there is brown wood cabinet, silver metal faucet, white wood bathroom sink, and white wood bed. On the right, there is nothing. In front of me, there is a silver metal faucet, silver glass mirror,white porcelain sink, brown wood cabinet, black mental wall lamp.  Behind me, there is an orange glass lamp, white porcelain tub, white cotton bed.\n
      Description 2: On the left, there is white porcelain sink and white wood bed. On the right, there are nothing. In front of me, there is a silver mental faucet and white plastic toiletry. Behind me, I can see white porcelain tub, black cloth curtain, white cotton bed.\n
      Shared Large Objects: Both descriptions mention silver metal faucets, white beds, and sink, contributing to a consistent thematic presence. Spatial Relationship: The placement of key items like silver metal faucets and brown wood cabinets described in similar configurations create a sense of coherence. Potential for Small Errors: Description 2 lacks specified items, such as accessory, door and countertop. Besides, there are small errors in the material of bed. Errors in material or color, as well as the potential omission of small-size objects, can indeed be attributed to variations in observation. Despite this, the two descriptions are depicting the same room, with the potential for small errors accounting for minor variations.\n

      Shared Large Objects: Both descriptions feature common large objects, including a wood bed and a silver metal wall lamp, though the color of bed is different. Spatial Relationships: Despite variations in surrounding details, the consistent mention of a white wood bed suggests a shared spatial context, possibly from different viewpoints within the same room. Minor differences, such as color variations in the bed, may be attributed to observational nuances rather than indicating distinct rooms, reinforcing the likelihood of the same room.\n

    Depiction2: {candidate_place_description}\n
    These are depictions of what I observe from two different vantage points. Please tell me if these two viewpoints correspond to the same {place_class}. It's important to note that the descriptions may originate from two positions within the {place_class}, each with a distinct angle. Therefore, the descriptions may pertain to the same {place_class} but not necessarily capture the same elements. Please be aware that my viewing angle varies, so it is not necessary for the elements to align in the same direction. As long as the relative positions between objects are accurate, it is considered acceptable. Please assess the arrangement of objects and identifiable features in the descriptions to determine whether these two positions are indeed in the same {place_class}. Provide a response of True or False, along with supporting reasons.'
